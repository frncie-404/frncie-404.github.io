Hello! To whoever stumblbes upon this repo I'd like to say I am mainly using this to host my Midterm Portfolio for my IT Elective.
I understand if someone where to check the code and realize it's sub-optimal, and I would love to learn more throughout my journey. Once Finals comes around I'd have been learning PHP by then. Though, it will take a while I am still excited to learn more about programming and web development.

Thank you for reading, but you can leave this repo alone now. Unless you want to sift through and give critique of the code, that's highly appreciated as well.
